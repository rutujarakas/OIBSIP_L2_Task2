                About the GOAT-King Kohli  
            </h1>  
<p>  
                ☛ Early Years and Passion for Cricket: Growing up in Delhi, Kohli showed an early passion for cricket, which led to his enrollment in a cricket academy at a young age.<br><br>  
                ☛ Rise in Domestic Cricket: Kohli's talent quickly became evident in domestic cricket, where he consistently scored runs and displayed leadership qualities.<br><br>  
                ☛ International Debut and Success: Making his international debut in 2008, Kohli's aggressive batting style and determination propelled him to success, earning him a permanent place in the Indian cricket team.<br><br>  
                ☛ Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL team, signs Virat on a youngster contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs when he is still a minor.  
                <br><br> ☛ Virat received his maiden call-up to the Indian ODI team and participated in the entire five-match series against Sri Lanka on the road. In the fourth game of the series, he hit his first 50, a 54-run inning.   
                <br><br> ☛ When Virat got his first ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111, it was worth the wait for him to return to the national squad.  
                <br><br> ☛ Virat participated in every game of India's victorious World Cup campaign in 2011, scoring his only century against Bangladesh in the opening match. Despite the fact that he didn't exactly light up the tournament with his bat, his final-round remark to Sachin has since become legendary in cricket: "Sachin Tendulkar has carried the weight of the nation for 21 years." Time for us to carry him on our shoulders  
                <br><br> ☛ Every cricketer will answer "play Test cricket" when asked what their dream is. In 2011, Virat finally had the opportunity to play in his first Test match against the West Indies. Unfortunately for the charming lad, it was a forgettable experience as he scored just 19 runs in the two innings he played.  
                <br><br> ☛ In the fourth and final test against Australia in Adelaide, Kohli achieved his first test hundred under somewhat dramatic circumstances. He just avoided being run out when batting with Ishant Sharma and nearly ran out of partners. However, he was unable to save India. 4-0 was our series loss.  
                <br><br> ☛ Virat led India to the CB Series final in Australia with what is undoubtedly one of the best ODI efforts by an Indian batsman, hitting 133 not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls. Hobart witnessed one of the greatest batting performances in history as India, who was chasing 321, reached the score in 37 overs.  
                <br><br> ☛ In place of an injured MS Dhoni, Virat was selected the stand-in ODI captain when India visited the West Indies. Earlier that year, he had also been named captain of his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.  
                <br><br> ☛ Batting Records: Kohli's batting records include being the fastest player to reach 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 runs in ODIs, solidifying his reputation as one of cricket's greatest batsmen.
                <br><br> ☛ Leadership Role: Kohli took over the captaincy of the Indian Test team in 2014, followed by leading the team across all formats in 2017, where he achieved notable victories and successes. 
                <br><br> ☛ He produced arguably his finest innings of his young career as India defeated Australia in Mohali to go to the ICC World T20 semifinals. As opposed to the lappa kind of cricket that is typically associated with 20 over cricket, his 82 off 51 balls was a magnificent effort, carved with timing and technique.
